# Personal Data Transmitter
A '[personal data transmitter](https://avp.fandom.com/wiki/Personal_Data_Transmitter)' functional LARP prop, vaguely modelled after the device in Aliens. Uses LoRa/GPS to share location information.

This is just a collection of CAD files for 3D printing, Arduino code and vague info not a fully formed 'instructable'.

The locator tube prop is slightly oversize to accomodate the screen and 18650 battery.

The wearable beacons are _vaguely_ like the watch device and powered by 13400 batteries but again somewhat bulkier than the original props.
